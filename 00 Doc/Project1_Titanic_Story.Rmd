#RMS Titanic
The RMS Titanic began her maiden voyage on April 10, 1912 and sank to the bottom of the ocean after hitting an iceberg 5 days later. To learn more about the Titanic, you can visit this page on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic).  
###Session Information
Before we get started with showing the plots, here is some information about how my RStudio is set up
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
###The Dataset
The data set used to produce the following graphs contains information on almost 900 passengers of that fateful ship. Here is a subset and summary of that data:

```{r}
source("../01 Data/Titanic_DataFrame.R", echo = TRUE)
```

###Plot 1: Fare and Age of Titanic Passengers broken down by gender
```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
source("../02 Visualizations/Age_Fare_Sex.R", echo = TRUE)
```
